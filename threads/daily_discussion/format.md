A place for /r/gamedev redditors to politely discuss random gamedev topics, share what they did for the day, ask a question, comment on something they've seen or whatever!

[Link to previous threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/gdevcss/search?q=flair:Daily+subreddit:gamedev&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).

General reminder to set your twitter flair via the sidebar for networking so that when you post a comment we can find each other.

Shout outs to:

 * /r/indiegames - a friendly place for polished, original indie games

 * /r/gamedevscreens, a newish place to share development/debugview screenshots daily or whenever you feel like it outside of SSS.

 * [Screenshot Daily](http://screenshotdaily.com), featuring games taken from /r/gamedev's Screenshot Saturday, once per day run by /u/pickledseacat / [@pickledseacat](http://twitter.com/pickledseacat)

We've recently updated [the posting guidelines](/r/gamedev/wiki/posting_guidelines_faq) too.
