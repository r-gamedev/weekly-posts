**FEEDBACK FRIDAY #%{counter}**

Well it's Friday here so lets play each-others games, be nice and constructive and have fun! keep up with devs on twitter and get involved!

Post your games/demos/builds and give each other feedback!

**Feedback Friday Rules:**

-Suggestion: if you post a game, try and leave feedback for at least one other game! We want you to express yourself, and if you feel that the bare minimum is enough, then okay. But some people choose to provide more feedback and we encourage that.

-Post a link to a playable version of your game or demo

-Do NOT link to screenshots or videos! The emphasis of FF is on testing and feedback, not on graphics! Screenshot Saturday is the better choice for your awesome screenshots and videos!

-Promote good feedback! Try to avoid posting one line responses like "I liked it!" because that is NOT feedback!

-Upvote those who provide good feedback!

-Comments using URL shorteners may get auto-removed by reddit, so we recommend not using them.
