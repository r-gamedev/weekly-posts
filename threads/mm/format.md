**What is Marketing Monday?**

Post your marketing material like websites, email pitches, trailers, presskits, promotional images etc., and get feedback from and give feedback to other devs.

**RULES**

* Do **NOT** try to promote your game to game devs here, we are not your audience. This is only for feedback and improvement.

* **Clearly state what you want feedback on otherwise your post may be removed. (Do not just dump Kickstarter or trailer links)**

* If you post something, try to leave some feedback on somebody else's post. It's good manners.

* If you do post some feedback, try to make sure it's *good feedback*: make sure it has the **what** ("The logo sucks...") and the **why** ("...because it's hard to read on most backgrounds").

* A very wide spectrum of items can be posted here, but try to limit yourself to **one or two important items** in your post to prevent it from being cluttered up.

* Promote good feedback, and upvote those who do! Also, don't forget to thank the people who took some of their time to write some feedback for you, even if you don't agree with it.

**Note:** Using url shorteners is discouraged as it may get you caught by Reddit's spam filter.
