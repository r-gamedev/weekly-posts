Post music and sounds that you've been working on throughout this week (or last (or whenever, really)). Feel free to give as much constructive feedback as you can, and enjoy yourselves!

**Basic Guidelines:**

* Do not link to a page selling music. We are not your target audience.
* Do not link to a page selling a game you're working on. We are not your target audience.
* It is highly recommended that you use SoundCloud to host and share your music.

As a general rule, if someone takes the time to give feedback on something of yours, it's a nice idea to try to reciprocate.

**If you've never posted here before, then don't sweat it. New composers of any skill level are always welcome!**
